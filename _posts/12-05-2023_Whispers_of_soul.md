We all harbor a universe within us, a symphony of thoughts and emotions that defines who we are. 

This post is more about my exploration of the universe within me.

Here I'll write about my acadmic interest: quantum computing in particular...

I have a deep appreciation for literature. I think there's something magical about the way words can paint pictures. It hits differently when you read a line that is so well written, you just close the book and stare at wall for a minute. I remember that 11 year old.. reading Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone during remidial classes, sitting on a back bench and hiding the book inside a NCERT textbook. Probably that was the starting of me falling for the books. I also write a little sometimes. Better to say, when I think too much, thoughts just search for a way out as writting. You can read some of it here.


We'll write here something about my other interest...

Music is an universal languages, beside love.


Here too... not commplete yet. But the ending is:

In this world, where quest for perfection prevails, here I'm.. a collage of unfinished tales, a mesmerizing blend of imperfect personalities, unfolding the whispers of my soul!
